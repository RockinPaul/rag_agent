{"task_id": "6af95c8f-8cbf-4c12-b02c-f9a23cc1ecb9", "model_answer": "28", "reasoning_trace": "The adventurer starts with 200 coins, 30 of which are face-down. He creates a pile of 30 coins. Let's say this pile has 'x' face-down coins. The remaining pile of 170 coins has '30-x' face-down coins. The adventurer flips all coins in his pile. Now his pile has '30-x' face-down coins. Both piles now have the same number of face-down coins ('30-x'), so the condition is met. The riddle states the larger pile (170 coins) has 14 face-down coins. So, 30-x = 14, which means x=16. The adventurer's pile has 30-x = 14 face-down coins. He gets 2 coins for each, so he wins 2 * 14 = 28 coins. FINAL ANSWER: 28"}

First, I counted the frequency of each letter in the Letter Bank. Then, I subtracted the letters needed for the first sentence ('I am a penguin halfway to the moon').
